## My Internship Experience at IIT Delhi

  So, Let's start from the beginning.
  
  There's Enterpreneurship and Development Programme called IHFC READY at IIT Delhi. I applied for the same and got selected for the Research and Development Internship at IIT Delhi. This programme aimed to Support the Startups and Entrepreneurs in their journey. I was assigned to work on a project related to Machine Learning and Data Science. The project was about developing a predictive model for a real-world problem using Machine Learning algorithms. I was excited to work on this project as it aligned with my interests and career goals.
  I was working with Problem statement of Drone Where my Job was to Develop the Machine Learning Model with can predict the mismanagement in Public gathering and can help in managing the crowd. The project was challenging and required me to apply my knowledge of Machine Learning, Data Science, and Python programming. I was eager to learn new concepts and enhance my skills during this internship.
  
  Let's Dive into Deeper and see how my Internship went at IIT Delhi.


## The Application Process

The Application Process was fairely Easy. You can check more info at [IHFC READY PROGRAMME IITD](https://www.ihfc.co.in/careers/)
Its just a simple process, you apply, you'll get mail if you're shortlisted and then you have to give a small interview. If you're selected, you'll get the mail for the same.


## Onboarding and Orientation

Internship started from july 1st and I was asked to report at IIT Delhi before 15th of july. The very first day when i Entered to The campus, We were asked to report at Thyagraj Sport complex. Where National Level hackthon was being held. We went there to get the insight about How people are building their rebot in such short interval time. It was great expriance, I met with many people who were running their startup and CEO of many company. I had Opportunity to talk with Senior manager of AutoDesk who were also there to guide the students.

## Work Environment

Everyday work starts with the meeting with team and our Professor Dr Akash Sondhi. Dr akash Sondhi is the most humblest and kind Person i've met. I have never saw him getting angry or upset over anything. The way they talk makes us to work with even more dedication. The work Environment is very friendly and supportive. I was working with 3 other interns and we were working on different project. We used to discuss our progress, share ideas, and help each other whenever needed. The team collaboration was excellent, and we were able to achieve our project goals effectively.



## Project Experience

We've got challenging project to complete.
Here's the problem statement:

In the recent year, India have faced many incident where the public gathering was not managed properly. However we can't blame to the public authorities for the same. Country Like india have massive population and it's not easy to manage the crowd. So, we were asked to develop a Machine Learning Model which can predict the mismanagement in Public gathering and can help in managing the crowd.

The model will be deployed in the drone and it will be used to monitor the public gathering. The model will predict the mismanagement in the crowd and will alert the authorities to take necessary actions. The model will be trained on the historical data of public gathering incidents and will use Machine Learning algorithms to predict the mismanagement in real-time.

We will share the technical details of the project, Stay Tune.


## Learning Opportunities

We're working in collaboration with Dr Aksh sondhi, Dr Venkat and other Top Professor of IIT Delhi. We have real time dataset and building something which will save people lives. Throughout the implementation of the project, It's huge opportunity to learn and Grow.


## Personal Growth

The Expose of IIT and Professor with their Almuni is pricesless.
