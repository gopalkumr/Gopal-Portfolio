## My Internship Experience at IIT Delhi

I am excited to share my experience as a Research and Development intern at IIT Delhi through the IHFC READY Programme. This initiative aims to support startups and entrepreneurs in their journey by connecting them with research institutions.

I was selected to work on an innovative Machine Learning project focused on crowd management using drone technology. The project aligned perfectly with my interests in AI and my career aspirations in the field of Data Science.

## The Application Process

The application process was straightforward and well-structured. Interested candidates can find detailed information at [IHFC READY PROGRAMME IITD](https://www.ihfc.co.in/careers/). The selection process consists of an initial application, followed by a shortlisting phase, and finally an interview for qualified candidates.

## Onboarding and Orientation

My internship commenced in July, with an orientation at the Thyagraj Sports Complex where a national-level hackathon was being held. This provided an excellent opportunity to observe innovative robotics projects and network with industry professionals, including startup founders and corporate leaders such as the Senior Manager from Autodesk.

## Work Environment

The daily workflow began with team meetings led by our mentor, Dr. Akash Sondhi. His leadership style fostered a collaborative and supportive environment that encouraged innovation and dedication. Working alongside three other interns on parallel projects, we maintained an atmosphere of knowledge sharing and mutual support that contributed significantly to our project's success.

## Project Experience

Our team was tasked with developing an AI-powered solution to address a critical challenge in public safety:

The project focused on creating a Machine Learning model for crowd management in India, where large public gatherings can pose significant safety risks. The solution involves deploying ML models on drones to monitor crowds in real-time, identifying potential safety concerns, and alerting authorities proactively.

Technical details of the implementation will be shared in an upcoming section.

## Learning Opportunities

The internship provided invaluable exposure to cutting-edge research under the guidance of distinguished faculty members including Dr. Akash Sondhi and Dr. Venkat. Working with real-world datasets and developing solutions with potential societal impact has been incredibly rewarding.

All project deliverables and presentations are available at [VisionML](https://visionml.tech).

## Professional Development

The exposure to IIT Delhi's academic environment and the opportunity to interact with faculty and alumni has provided invaluable networking opportunities and insights into the field.
