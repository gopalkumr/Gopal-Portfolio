# Vgpt: LLM Powered by Azure OpenAI with OCR Capabilities

![VisionML Platform](/assets/images/dynamic/vgpt/vgpt-banner.png)

## Overview

In the rapidly evolving landscape of AI applications, I've developed VGPT (accessible at [chat.visionml.tech](https://chat.visionml.tech)), a specialized language model that combines the power of Azure OpenAI's GPT-3.5 with Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capabilities through Azure Vision. Built with React, TypeScript, and Vite, VGPT represents a significant step forward in creating more versatile and accessible AI tools.

## Technical Architecture

VGPT's architecture consists of three main components:

1. **Frontend Interface**: Built with React, TypeScript, and Vite
2. **Language Model**: Powered by Azure OpenAI's GPT-3.5
3. **OCR Engine**: Implemented using Azure Vision services

This architecture enables VGPT to not only process and generate text like traditional LLMs but also to "see" and interpret text from images, making it a truly multimodal AI system.

## The Power of OCR Integration

The integration of OCR capabilities sets VGPT apart from standard language models. By leveraging Azure Vision's advanced OCR technology, VGPT can:

- Extract text from uploaded images
- Process screenshots containing text
- Analyze documents and diagrams
- Interpret handwritten notes (with reasonable accuracy)

This functionality opens up numerous use cases that would be impossible with text-only models, from automating data entry to assisting visually impaired users.

## Implementation Details

### Frontend Development

The frontend was built using React with TypeScript for type safety and Vite for its exceptional development experience. Key implementation details include:

```typescript
// Image upload component with preview functionality
const ImageUploader: React.FC = () => {
  const [image, setImage] = useState<File | null>(null);
  const [preview, setPreview] = useState<string | null>(null);
  
  const handleImageChange = (e: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => {
    if (e.target.files && e.target.files[0]) {
      const selectedImage = e.target.files[0];
      setImage(selectedImage);
      
      // Create preview URL
      const reader = new FileReader();
      reader.onloadend = () => {
        setPreview(reader.result as string);
      };
      reader.readAsDataURL(selectedImage);
    }
  };
  
  const handleSubmit = async () => {
    if (!image) return;
    
    const formData = new FormData();
    formData.append('image', image);
    
    try {
      const response = await fetch('/api/process-image', {
        method: 'POST',
        body: formData,
      });
      
      // Process response...
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Error processing image:', error);
    }
  };
  
  return (
    <div className="image-uploader">
      <input type="file" accept="image/*" onChange={handleImageChange} />
      {preview && <img src={preview} alt="Preview" className="image-preview" />}
      <button onClick={handleSubmit} disabled={!image}>
        Process Image
      </button>
    </div>
  );
};
